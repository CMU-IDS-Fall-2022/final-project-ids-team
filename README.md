# Abstract

In this project we look at a dataset of the Top 50 Billboard songs from the years 2010 to 2019 and use Spotify's musical features to perform analysis. In particular, we look to answer three overarching questions:
1. Overall Popularity Analysis: What makes these songs popular?
2. Trends in Popular Songs: How has popularity changed over time?
3. Song Recommendations: Can we recommend similar songs from a given input?
